### WHZ LoopRoom 🎧
WHZ LoopRoom is a web app that turns any song into clean background music (BGM) directly in the browser.

You upload a track, tweak a few controls, and get a remixed BGM version you can download.

### Live Demo
👉 https://whz-looproom.streamlit.app/

### What the App Does
Upload a song (.mp3 / .wav)

Change speed and pitch

Add bass, highs, reverb, and lofi

Automatically split the song into Intro, Drop, and Outro and remix it

Preview a slice, then export the final BGM as a .wav

#### How the AI Agent Was Used
This project was built in an agentic way:

I asked an AI coding agent to build a BGM remix tool in Streamlit

The agent wrote most of the core logic:

Audio effects: bass, highs, reverb, lofi

Speed and pitch controls

Section splitting (Intro / Drop / Outro)

Export pipeline for the final BGM file

### I mainly:

Defined the idea and feature set

Guided the agent with prompts and iterations

Cleaned up small issues and deployed to Streamlit Community Cloud

In practice, the AI agent generated the majority of the remix logic, and I focused on steering, wiring, and deployment.

### Tech Stack
